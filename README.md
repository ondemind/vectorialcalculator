# Vectorial Calculator
A vector calculator that I made using the Python Math Library. It's functionality is intended for automate the tedious process of making the calcs oneself in the vector fields of mathematics

Every proccess of operations is made in base from what I saw on my math classes at High School. So if there's anything wrong on the operations, you know who blame first... I'm a beginner in the Python language code, so, if there's any way to simplify the code or if you want to add another operations, please let me know making a pull request on my repository.

I'll try to make updates in my code in the future, if I have time to do so.

Warning: This is NOT something that is intended to use to cheat on math exams or evaluations, this is something that I made in, well, in a boredom situation.
